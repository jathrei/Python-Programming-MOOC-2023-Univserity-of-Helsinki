# 2.1: Programming terminology

statement: part of the program that executes something

if name == "Anna":

    print("Hi!")

    number = 2

two statements: a print statement and an assignement statement within the conditional "if" statement

blocks are seperated and determined by indentation


expressions: code that results in the determination of a data type

example: x = 2 * 5 > 7, the data type is a boolean

y = "abc" + "def", the data type is a string

function: takes in arguments/paramets. ex: the print function

print(type("ANNA")) will print the data type 

use a ":" after a conditional 

utilize print statements to debug code

len function: determines the lenght of a string
