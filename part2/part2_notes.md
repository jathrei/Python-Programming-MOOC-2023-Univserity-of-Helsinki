# Part 2: Programming terminology, conditionals, loops

# 2.1: Programming terminology

statement: part of the program that executes something

if name == "Anna":

    print("Hi!")

    number = 2

two statements: a print statement and an assignement statement within the conditional "if" statement

blocks are seperated and determined by indentation


expressions: code that results in the determination of a data type

example: x = 2 * 5 > 7, the data type is a boolean

y = "abc" + "def", the data type is a string

function: takes in arguments/paramets. ex: the print function

print(type("ANNA")) will print the data type 

use a ":" after a conditional 

utilize print statements to debug code

> **len function: determines the lenght of a string**
> exaple: length = len("Apple"), length would equal 5

**TYPECASTING**

> Float to INT rounds down, all the way. it is a floor funciton
> int is also a funciton. example floor_num = int(num), where num is a float will round it down

# 2.2: More Conditionals

> elif used to imrpove speed of execution, that is: its not like its checking each if statement. Its a faster way to not check certain conditionals unnecessarily. 

> Python comparison operators can also be used on strings (alphabetical order) ex: "alpha">"beta" would return true
